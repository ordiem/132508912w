                            <p>There's a hormone called GLPâ€‘1 that tells your brain when to stop eating. It used to work with high effectiveness. But after 45, it drops off and meals stop feeling as satisfying.</p>
                            <p>That's why you can eat a full plate and still feel hungry an hour later. You're not greedy. Your body's chemical "off switch" is weaker.</p>
                            <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Add more protein, fiber, and real fat to meals. They help activate GLPâ€‘1 naturally and keep you full longer.</p>

                            <p>You lose muscle every year after 50 whether you notice it or not. And muscle isn't just for looks. It burns calories around the clock.</p>
                            <p>So with less muscle, your metabolism slows. You're burning fewer calories doing the exact same things you've always done.</p>
                            <p>The kicker? Most diets make this worse by causing muscle loss on top of fat.</p>
                            <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Lift weights. Eat enough protein. Muscle is your metabolism's best friend.</p>

                            <p>After 50, stress hits harder and your body gets worse at handling it. That means cortisol, your main stress hormone, stays elevated longer.</p>
                            <p>High cortisol tells your body to store fat, especially around your middle. It also drives cravings for sugar, salt, and comfort food, whether you're actually hungry or not.</p>
                            <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Managing stress isn't a luxury. It's a weight-loss tool. Walk, breathe, lift, sleep on a daily basis.</p>

                            <p>Sleep gets lighter and more broken after 50. Blame hormones, night sweats, bathroom trips, or just an overactive mind.</p>
                            <p>Poor sleep doesn't just make you tired; it changes your appetite. It increases ghrelin, which makes you feel hungry. At the same time, it lowers leptin, the hormone that makes you feel full. As a result, you eat more and crave unhealthy foods, even if you aim to eat healthy.</p>
                            <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Focus on sleep like a workout. Dark room. Cool temperature. No screens.</p>
